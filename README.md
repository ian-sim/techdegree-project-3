 Interactive Form
 
For this project I have aimed for the 'exceeds expectations' grade.
 
I have made this web form interactive by implementing some conditionals that only allow the user to see or select certain options based on the choices they have made as well as displaying error messages for incorrect user input.
 
I have also added real-time error messages to the name, email and credit card information input fields. I decided it would make for good practice to give all of the input fields real-time errors instead of just one.
 
Just for fun I have added a CSS animation to make the error messages pulse from a slightly dark red to a brighter red.
